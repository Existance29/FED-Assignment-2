This website focuses on e-commerce with gamification features. This website sells gaming-related gear, such as gaming mice, keyboards, audio devices and PCs. The gamification revolves around a lucky draw, where users can earn different items, such as credits and products. To earn the currency spent on the lucky draw, users can play the in-site games. The better they do on the games, the more draws they earn. When purchasing items, users can also earn additional draws based on how much they spend ($50 = 1 draw)

## Design Process
The target audience are youths who are interested in gaming-related technology

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
