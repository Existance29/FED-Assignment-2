This website focuses on e-commerce with gamification features. This website sells gaming-related gear, such as gaming mice, keyboards, audio devices and PCs. The gamification revolves around a lucky draw, where users can earn different items, such as credits and products. To earn the currency spent on the lucky draw, users can play the in-site games. The better they do on the games, the more draws they earn. When purchasing items, users can also earn additional draws based on how much they spend ($50 = 1 draw)
